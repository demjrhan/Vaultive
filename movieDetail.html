            Wade Wilson, a former special forces operative turned mercenary, undergoes an experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers and a twisted sense of humor. Now as the masked anti-hero Deadpool, he hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his life. Packed with action, comedy, and breaking-the-fourth-wall moments, *Deadpool* is a refreshingly unconventional superhero story.
